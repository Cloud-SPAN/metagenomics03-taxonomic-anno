In this lesson we will be discussing how to assign a taxonomy to your metagenome data. We will discuss how taxonomy assignment works. We will be discussing the differences in assignment, through alignment and k-mer matching, and the software that uses these different methods. We will also talk about kraken2 which we will be using for this, and the importance of selecting an appropriate database. We will also talk about how you can visualise these results using [pavian](https://github.com/fbreitwieser/pavian). Once you have your taxonomy and can visualise it, we will then move onto how to explore the level of diversity and discuss alpha and beta diversity metrics using the [phyloseq and ggplot2 in R](https://cloud-span.github.io/metagenomics03-taxonomic-anno/02-Diversity-tackled-with-R/index.html).
